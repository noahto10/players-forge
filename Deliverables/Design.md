## 1. Description

PlayersForge is a website with a dedicated, free to join community for uploading and downloading mods. Users can access the PlayersForge website on their web browser and sign up 
to become apart of the modding community; gaining access to mods such as skins, maps, etc. Each of the mods are categorized and sorted by the game they are for and the type of mod. 

The PlayersForge website is currently still in early development, with multiple features to be implemented in the near future (community forum, dedicated mod pages, user profiles).
The website provides a sleak and simple design, allowing for users to easily navigate and locate their desired mods. The homepage currently features the most popular/most downloaded mods

## 2. Architecture

We designed out system architecture to have four layers: psql & flask, models & forms, app, and serve. Psql & flask consists of packages downloaded for the website to work, configuration, a flask environment file for easy refresh changes, and sqlalchemy to connect with out database models. Then, modles & forms consist of all of our database models and forms, for example: Users database model and RegisterUsers form. Then, the app layers consists of routes for the website, templates (html) and static files (css, images, etc.). Lastly, there is the serve file, which is the system of connecting our github website folder to aws in order to serve the website.

## 6. Design Principles
We used the following SOLID design principles for our project.
Single responsibility principle: An example we used for this is the logout function. For logout() the purpose of it is calling another function which does the rest of the work. Thus it only has a single responsibility. Other examples include the index() and mods() functions which their only purpose is to return from a select form. 

Open/Closed principle: An open/closed principle example is our SignUpForm and LoginForm. These forms are part of the entire login and sign up process. They are loaded in and closed upon user completion. 

Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP): DIP is used in our project. In the Users class the class depends on abstractions instead of lower level modules. The model carries a user's information automatically to the database.
